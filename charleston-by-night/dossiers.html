                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Thaddeus Crowe is a figure of calm authority along Charleston’s bustling waterfront. Long-time overseer of the docks and key properties, he has been a mentor, patron, or guiding hand to each of you in some way. Crowe is known for his meticulous nature, his insistence on discretion, and his uncanny ability to maintain order in a city teeming with ambition, rivalry, and secrets.</p>
                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>Elegant, commanding, and deliberate, Crowe carries the aura of old-world aristocracy. He values loyalty, competence, and subtlety. While kind and encouraging at times, he has little patience for recklessness or indiscretion — yet those who earn his trust gain both protection and opportunity.</p>  
                    <h3>Current Status</h3>
                    <p>Recently, Crowe vanished from the city under mysterious circumstances. In his absence, the Waterfront — his carefully maintained domain — has been left in your hands. His final instructions to each of you were clear: “Guard Charleston’s heart well, for it beats beneath the waves.”</p>
